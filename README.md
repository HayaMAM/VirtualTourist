# VirtualTourist & You Decide Project 

Vitual Tourist is an application that gives the ability for tourists to navigate the map and show pictures of the cities
that they pick using the flicker API. Users can add pins by pressing the on the desired location which will move them to an ablum of picures from that location. For the You Decide Project I added the Dark Sky API so that tourists can search
for the city weather that they're interested to go to. It shows the weather of the whole week.
